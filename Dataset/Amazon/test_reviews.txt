Bottom line, there are some serious flaws in the author's thinking. For example, in chapter 11 (Tariffs), the author argues that imposing a $5 tariff on an import (sweaters from England) ends up costing the US. Never once does he add the $5 duty received into the equation. How can someone argue against an import tax without analyzing what happens to the revenues from that tax? When the next chapter stated that Exports must equal Imports, I quit reading.In short, I couldn't agree more with the author that all too often the analysis of costs/benefits focus is too narrow. Yet, in trying to expanding the analysis beyond the 'too narrow', the author's analysis in fact is often too narrow.
I gave this movie a 5 out of 5 cause the movie itself is awesome. Absolutely just amazing...BUTI had to give the special features a 1 out of 5 casue they suck.Thats just the only way to describ them. There NOTHING of intrest really. Just some intreviews with people about the movie, some other crap about underwater life and stuff. ABSOLUTELY NO SPECIAL FEATURES about spongebob, NO SPECIAL FEATURES for Kids. They would HATE these lame excuses for special features..... nothing interesting or fun at all.Boo to everyone who had imput on this DVD for the spcial features, they really droped the bomb on it !!!!
I recognize that lots of people think this book is wonderful. However, as an extremely well-read English major, I think Marquez must be laughing. Without repeating the comments of the other one-star reviewers, I'll just say that I was more than underwhelmed. It's nonsenical, and (am I the only one who noticed?) misogynistic.
I don't know what happened, because the company I purchased the CD from would never respond to my e-mails. I highly recommend to anyone purchasing anything from this company to please read over all the reviews before you purchase from them. I ordered the product on July 10, 2012. It was suppose to be delivered from July 17 to August 1. I have yet to get the product or an explanation from anyone. I will never purchase anything from them again and hope you think twice before anyone else does. Thank You!!!!!
Let's keep this simple: promising plot ruined by -Bad acting.Poor and often ignorant dialogue (scripting).Inconsistent plot elements (slow walking zombies, then fast ones, then back to slow).An inhabited island overrun by zombies, yet not a SINGLE boat was available anywhere.Piss poor directing.What else is there left to say?
My 1 star rating is due to the fact that Oxford University Press gives away the plot twists and even the shocker ending in the second paragraph of their Introduction. Most of the fun of reading any novel is trying to find out what will happen next. Oxford spoils this by giving it away at the start (what were they thinking?!!!). If you pick up this edition, just skip the Intro, or read it AFTER the book. Otherwise, Hardy's novel is a great story with insight into noble character. Hardy gets 5 stars, Oxford U Press gets 1.
Super stupid Keanu Reeves monster movie that is so bad, I'm waiting for it to come on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Keanu is at his worse with this film and it shows on his face that even he thinks the movie is bad. Out of the entire cast, Only Rachel Weisz(Runaway Jury) and Peter Stourmar(Bad Boys 2) give credible performances that are way better than the movie itself. Rachel Weisz does more with her part than the screenwriters and the director did with making the movie and gives the film an unnecessary great performance that a way better movie could have used instead and Peter Stourmar gives class and dignity to an underwritten role that is only in the movie for about five minutes.See it for Rachel Weisz and Peter Stourmar ONLY, because the rest of the film is really bad.
I notice that 9 of the reviews are posted by the same person, A Customer. It looks like the author is trying to get a better rating by making up reviews. The book is trash don't buy it.
ok clay has a good vocie but come on hes ugly in the songs are the same'ol pop songs just think of him as another ruben good vocie but to ugly but one thing ruben can sing better in is a real singer with good song but clay sucks big time he wont be big so trust me on this one i know music in i know when i say this cd ant worth it dont buy it ant worth the money theres not even one good song on this cd this whole cd sucks so DONT BUY IT
I bought this backpack a while ago, despite my reservations about having the opening for the laptop compartment on the side. The obvious danger is to forget closing the zipper, and it won't take much for your laptop to go flying ... Naturally I tried to be careful about closing it, but one day I must have been distracted or in a hurry, and when I took off the backpack, my laptop fell on the floor. Many other computer backpacks also have a strap that secures the laptop, and prevents it from moving around; this one doesn't. Otherwise it is quite nice and comfortable, but I won't use it for laptop duty anymore.
This is a disappointing film. The first two films managed to include a story with the special effects. This one didn't really bother. Mind numbing, and in a bad way.
You can't throw out the baby with the bathwater! If you feel that our Judicial system is flawed because it is not being held accountable - wouldn't that be an argument for more checks and balances not less?So then what is this really about? I believe that the author is afraid of social evolution (as evidenced by her other books.) Although I don't understand why she is - without it she couldn't be an author, lawer, columnist, AND be the mother of six. Anyways, she would like to replace our judges with know it alls like herself. She does a good job of presenting the facts that back up her agenda, but she misses any evidence of how the system that she proposes would be doomed to fail. After all, history shows us the ugly death of all previous Theocracies. If you are afraid of moving forward, this book is for you. If not save your money for a book with more balance.
"Typical Douglas, in his self aggrandizing style, makes himself the authority on all crime related topics. If Douglas could downsize his ego, it would make it easier to read. For example, despite what the police, the state, and even his former colleagues in the FBI considered about the Ramsey case, Douglas ""alone"" has it solved -- i.e. the parents, from whom he took a substantial sum of money for his ""consultation"", are innocent. Incredible that Douglas makes such a conclusion, even though he wasnt privvy to the evidence, as the FBI was and who came to a markedly different conclusion about the parents' involvement.A waste of time to read this book. I have to agree with McCrary and Ressler, two greatly respected FBI profilers, that Douglas has gone Hollywood."
Spider-Man 1 & 2 Does not include any of the amazing behind the scenes content originally released on the DVDs. Why would a studio release two extraordinary FX films of this magnitude and incredible production values on a format that can hold so much information, and fail to include the extras? If you're a fan of behind the scenes content, hold onto your DVDs.Movie - A+. Blu-Ray value for Spider-Man 1&2 - FAIL.
For the price this very simple apparatus should function flawlessly. Its one job is to hold sand. I wish I noticed out of the box that one of the edges of the bottom where it meets the frame was bowed out enough to leak sand (salty looking sand) all over my desk. Annoying. I scooted as much sand out of the way as I could to duct tape this edge on the inside. When I have the time, I'll probably dump out the sand and tape all the edges because I don't trust it.The hassle this has caused is definitely not zen.
its is unclear rather this really works with G4 Powerbook. the connector that plugs in to the powerbook fits , but the connection itself is unstable and easily disrupted by just a little wiggle or touch of the cable or connector. If you are looking for a replacement cable go with Apple branded. that one works .
Received this as a gift from my husband. He had it gift wrapped and held it for the occasion. When I opned the bracelet, we were both very disappointed. The quality was very poor and bracelet did hand nicely on the wrist. He contacted the seller through Amazon to request a refund. They refused to refund or exchange the item. Unfortunately he had not opened the item when it was received, since it was gift wrapped. He held it beyond their return window, as he was saving it to be gifted. I called the vendor myself to explain and seek a compromise. They were unyeilding, explaining that they could not return the bracelet to their vendor or restock it, so we were out of luck. Beware of the return policy with this vendor especially if it is a gift.
"While this is a fairly well written book anyone that has ever been connected to Manson, Manson's followers, or the Manson case has said there was no way that Charles Manson had ANYTHING to do with this book.First of all, Manson, while speaking makes NO sense whatsoever.Secondly, If anyone has ever seen Manson's written word, not only does it not make any sense, but it's not legible.Third, The ""frame"" that the wording is in, does not sound like anything I have ever seen, read, or heard from Manson.Fourth, Manson himself has denied having anything to do with this book since it was being written, through publication, through all the years since.Some of the information in this book is factual, based upon trial transcripts, and conversations that are documented elsewhere. However the words that are attributed to Manson, in my opinion were the author's own words. Not a bad read, but not something I would recommend to someone looking for the 'truth'."
I'm frustrated by things that never get fixed on this product. I use the Sansa View to listen to 1-hour mp3 recordings from a class I'm taking. If I pause the recording in the middle and resume later in the day (after the Sansa has powered down), the recording NEVER starts where I left it!!!!! The most frustrating thing is that I've reported this problem to SanDisk over 6 months ago and it is never addressed, even though my problem was acknowledged by their tech support.To further complicated things, the fast forward does not accelerate, so when I need to get back to the 30th minute of the recording, I have to hold down the fast-forward button for about five minutes. I also reported this problem over 6 months ago with the same result -- acknowledged by tech support but never addressed.With the amount of firmware updates they've made, this is clearly a product being beta tested on the customers.
"at first this seems like the perfect antirvirus program... cheap, uses up very minimal resources, simple to use.. lifetime subscription for free.. what could be wrong?EVERYTHING. see, the problem isn't that this program can't find viruses.. the problem is IT FINDS THEM AND DOESN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THEM. that's right, it leaves the viruses right there!! how is that useful in any way? i looked in options to make sure it cleaned or deleted viruses, but still the log report would announce to me ""(this many) viruses could not be deleted or cleaned."" well, thanks for nothing. i'm going to return this and get a real antivirus program."
I was very disappointed with this book. I found the heroine to be too childish and tedious; she fought over everything and after a while it became annoying. His brother Rafael should have been the hero - he had more guts!
"Let me start by saying there is nothing ""wrong"" with these weights. The quality is great, and the material is soft. However, when people say small...they mean it! I am a petite size 2 and they only barely fit. I actually got these for therapy use for my one-year old's ankles and these were the only one-pounders I could find. They fit my chuncky little one just perfectly."
"I read this in the 1980's, and it was a non-event back then. Like most books that claim to have ""the answer,"" this book gives an enormously over-simplified view of economics that does not reflect the real world. Moreover, it presents as settled many open questions, claiming the authors opinions as facts. There are many better books on free-market economics, and far, far better books on economics in general."
I ordered this DVD since I loved the Trinity movies. The picture was horrible. It was as if Fellini was on acid. The dubbing was terrible and the story was uniteresting. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
When I order a book I expect a Book 6x9 inches, what I received was an shrunken facimily 4x7 trying very hard to make it to the major leagues. I would send it back but it would cost more than the imitation is worth.
UH OH CLAYMATES!!! Clay's album has fallen out of the top twenty sellers on Amazon.com!!! Quick, better buy ten more copies to get him back up there! Because we all know you can judge the greatness of a record by how many copies get sold. (NOT!)
This was a gift, but the fabric was cheap and didn't look great on or last well. However It was fun, and I got compliments on it all night.
This would be a nifty little contraption if it wasn't for the fact that you can't change the top -- my primary impetus for buying it.I have a Handspring Visor and lost my stylus. I didn't want to pay for shipping on a new stylus 3-pack from Handspring, so I went to Best Buy and purchased this instead. Not only can you not change the top so that it fits in the Visor properly, but now the entire headpiece falls out constantly so that the bottom part of the stylus gets stuck in the stylus-holder. Oh, and did I mention that the light function only works part of the time?Not worth your time or effort.
Horrible horror misfire that lacks a lot of brains and lacks a credible leading man for the movie to really fly. While Keanu Reeves is miscast in the worse way, it's Rachel Weisz who steps up to the plate and carries the movie into respectability. Her performance is much better than the story and the special effects that is in this film and for that, the movie is bearable but other than her grand effort to transcend the lousy script, there is really nothing to see here other than her performance.Wait for Dvd.
these diapers are basicly the same as a size 1 but the problem is that you can't get something comapable to a size 2 , I ordered size 3 after these no longer fit and the things are huge and constantly leak .hope pampers sees this and goes back to old sizing because pampers are the best for leaks etc but this stupid 1-2 combo is insane !!!
This game is only for kids and if you play the game for a while you will get bored unless you are usually the age of 8 or under. The game is cute. I'm not looking for cute games. I mean shooting water, getting slimed, and doing a food fight is for kids. When you buy it, you will only like the games for probably like the game for 3 days unless you are a big Nickelodeon freak.
It looks great, lcd screen with media card slots was nice touch..but what good is it if it can't take in any paper to PRINT ANY THING OUT ...I was able to get it to take in paper using exclusive HP paperand ONE PAPER at a time it works SOME TIMES.My first HP printer and it will be my LAST,when I run out of Ink on the darn thing, rather thanburning 60 bucks for INK I would buy a LEXMARK again.
This one looks like a childrens super hero atmosphere, because the writter of this one thought that kids would want to see it instead of grownups. Unfortunately this one was a box office flop.
I don't understand is this book made of gold or gasoline? Why the hell does it cost sooo much? Does the author David Moody come to your home and actually read the book to you? When you order this book do you get 25 copies? I have many more questions about this book, but I don't wish or want to waste my time. Hope this review helps, maybe when I get back from overseas, get out of the military, sell my home or first born just maybe I will be able to afford such a luxurious book. This explains why the local library doesn't have the book.
Without Stephen Gammell's artwork, these are pretty close to worthless.Why would they EVER replace the original, incredible artwork? The reality is, Harper Collins, that Stephen Gammell's artwork MADE these classics.The artwork now is unoriginal, not the least bit frightening (or artful), and does nothing to complement the stories.Huge mistake. Someone should be fired. At least five people should be fired... and blacklisted.This is an atrocity.Prospective buyers: go buy the other versions! Oh, that's right, they're extremely expensive. I wonder why, Harper Collins? You fools.And again for good measure: you fools.
MR. BROKAW REPRESENTS AN ELIST POINT OF VIEW, PORTRAYING THE FACT THAT CHICANOS PLAYED ALMOST NO ROLE IN THIS GENERATION. THAT CHICANOS DID NOT DIE IN GREAT NUMBERS DURING WORLD WAR II AND EARNED THE MOST CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONORS, THAT CHICANOS LEADETRS LIKE CEASAR CHAVEZ PLAYED NO ROLE IN LABOR RELATIONS OR THE GREAT UPRAISING OF CHICANO CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND THE ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATION PLAYED NO PART IN THE HISTORY OF THE SOUTHWEST OR THAT CIVIL RIGHT VIOLATION LIKE THE ZOOT SUIT RIOTS OR SLEEPY LAGON CASE WAS INSIGNIFICANT.
I ordered a Canon camera battery. NB-5L.Some company (not Amazon) sent the wrong battery.I tired to send it back. Too complicated. (Many emails, lots of forms.) I found someone who needed the incorrect battery (NB-4L) and gave it to them.Then I went to a real store and bought the correct battery.Bad taste in my mouth remains.
"If you read a ""Dummies"" book before then you know the format. The first part of the book is divided into lessons, then there are three sample tests in the back.I thought the lessons were good, but not great compared to some of the other ASVAB books out there. The book did a great job of telling you upcoming changes to the ASVAB as advertised.What really turned me off from this book was when I was doing the sample tests and there were a couple answers that were clearly wrong. For instance, the question for General Science was what Chromosomes does a female have. The answers in the back said ""XY"" while it should have been ""XX"". This was just one of a few I found.While the style remains the same as most dummies books, I cant recommend this to anyone based on the errors in the sample tests. If you dont plan on doing sample tests then this book might be for you."
"I had read this book over 30 years ago as a teenager and thought it would be interesting to see how I reacted to it now. It's a fun and easy read, I'll admit that. But I can see why I liked it more as a 14-year-old; the book seems to have been written by a 14-year-old. And the ""moral dilemmas"" are of the kind you probably dealt with when you first learned what a ""moral dilemma"" is.And although the copy I read was a paperback from the early 1980's that was in its umpteenth printing, it had a surprising number of typos and major grammatical errors. I guess even back then no one took the book too seriously."
I bought these shirts for $6 each thinking that I've got a bargain, but once I received them was disappointed in my purchase. As previous reviewers mentioned, the material is flimsy, 60% cotton - 40% polyester (and feel like the latter), the fit is improper and finish poor. Am wearing one of the shirts now, and it wears uncomfortably (feels like a poorly made medical scrub) and looks just as cheap (yes, even the French Blue color). Will either send these back or they will end up collecting dust in my closet.
The usual action scenes, but ridiculous plot holes. The vast majority of the plot points made no sense whatsoever, I think Michael Bay is trying to make the worst possible movie that still makes millions of dollars.
"Inserting this card in my new Minolta Dimage 7i (digital camera), I get an ""Unable to use card"" error. The card is evidently incompatible with the 7i. Others have had the same experience. See the digital camera forums.Check the compatibility chart at minoltausa.com before you buy!"
I prefer the Pampers Swaddler, It was my mistake I got the wrong kind but had already placed my order and didnt realize that they weren't swaddler. Gave my poor baby a rash. These diapers are too thin for my baby. Not pleased at all
"I was really happy with my TiVo for the first 6 months. Then I received an error message that data wouldn't load. After researching on the TiVo website forums and finding many others have had the same problem, I followed their instructions and tried to ""kickstart"" it. This process did not fix the box but TiVo tells me I crashed my TiVo. TiVo says I need to return it and they will fix it under warranty, but they will not let me out of the service contract unless I pay $200 termination fee since it is under warranty and they've offered to fix it. Personally, I would prefer to go back to my cable company's DVR - the box costs me nothing but the monthly fee which is half of what TiVo charges.TiVo has TERRIBLE customer service!!!!"
It worked for about a month. Even when it did work it was a hit or miss thing. I had to fool with it for a while. Maybe it was because I bought the cheapest one available. Maybe it was a knock-off, who knows? I have yet to try it on another computer to rule out it not being the cord. Fair warning.
I purchase a Protect-A-Bed mattress cover at a mattress store, salesman said to wash it twice prior to use. He did not say to dry it with towels and sheets. Its supposed to be waterproof, one of our cats proved its not, contacted company, they asked if dried on medium with towels and other bedding, I said no, no one told me and not anywhere on package does it state needs to be protected in the dryer. Company sent another cover,this time on low setting which is mostly air fluff with towels and other sheets and it was scorched in 3 places. Both were scorched on medium and low heat, dryer is electric which is not as hot as gas. I'm getting my $90 back that I was charged at a mattress company. Not worth the money if you can't dry it because it has cheap plastic backing.
This is essentially a live action G.I. Joe film for people with IQ's below 85. I walked out after about 5-10 minutes. I changed the ticket over to Jackass 2 and laughed harder than I have in years during a movie.
I love Brett Helquist. His illustrations for A Series of Unfortunate Events, for example, are wonderful. However, his work does not belong here. Stephen Gammell's illustrations are really what made these books the classics that they are (no offense meant to Alvin Shwartz). I will be looking for copies with the proper illustrations as soon as I can find them.
"OK. I picked this up as a light weekend read, not expecting ""War and Peace"" but something fun.This book was as trite as a 1970s Harlequin romance. By the end of the first chapter, I had predicted the character development and plot twists to the very last page. The characters were horribly stereotypical and one-dimenensional. The ""nice girl"", the evil vengenful ""psycho-girl"", the ""I've having an affair with a married man and want some permanence in my life, girl"", the ""torn between job vs family girl""..I could go on forever...The only thing that kept me reading to the end was to find out if my predictions panned out.Also any author who uses the word ""frission"" twice in 10 pages should be locked in a room and required to read Strunk's ""Elements of Style"" until they learn to write beyond a 10 grade level.All in all a waste of my time and the author's."
I thought this movie was boring and it didn't let you get to know any of the characters. The only good thing in this movie is a young, cute Mel Gibson.
Cities of the Red Night is William Burrough's magnum opus, the most sublime manefestation of his genius. From the opening chapter titles and hallucinatory invocation to the exquisitely fashioned closing dream sequence, each word bears the stamp of the studiously enigmatic visionary stylist. This novel impressed itself to the point that I met one of the characters in a dream, a truly disorienting experience. Sure, it's disjointed. Innoculation to the parasitic authority of the word virus, to see and feel in another medium, whaddaya think the poor guy's tryna say here, anyways?
"What a hoot! I've been a fan of these guys from the beginning, through thick and thin, and this set captures a truly remarkable performance. My only complain is that the audio quality seems to take a dump in the end of disc two. Geoff and Pamela sound way overmodulated, and the weird blurry effect that distorts the image of the two is distracting.The best parts? ""Suite Sister Mary"" from OMCI and ""Fear City Slide"" from OMCII.Awesome stuff!"
A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was one of the best novels I have read.When I first looked at it I thought it would be long and boring but when I actually read it, it was hard to put down as well as very interesting.The book is mostly tragic, but has it's share of funny moments.It makes you look at history at a diffrent perspective than what we mostly think of it.I suggest this as good summer reading for anyone who enjoys historical fiction or anyone looking for a good read.
Beautiful movie. I always admired Danish cinematography and this feature was the best so far. Fabulous set of very talented actors. I loved it and would definitely recommend it to everyone.
These are very attractive looking glasses that feel very nice. They are well made and not flimsy, yet they are not heavy to hold. They make whatever you are drinking seem to be more of a treat.
This wasn't the fastest ship in the world but it was shipped in great condition (which I am sure is difficult for a paper back) I love the book, I have read it several times before, just wanted to add it to my collection.
Everyone else tells the details, but this really said nothing new and has little that is new. The untold plot had already been told in the movies and this only reenforces it. I personally disappointed with episode 22 with the fact that the music which really made the secene so memorable was dimmed down alot. I'm not saying this dvd is bad, I'm just saying I would think about it a little bit more on how you spend your money.
I have this as a paperback but didn't want to dig it out of storage before seeing John Carter of Mars. I wanted to refresh my memory of this fun story. It is a dry narration of John Carter's experience. As I was thinking, the movie butchered the story. I originally read this story in junior high along with the entire series. This is a storystory best read and not seen at the theaters. I've also read the Gor series which has a similar storyline.
I bought this Hoya 55mm Circ Polarizer filter for my Sony SLT A 55 and I must say that I have liked the results that this filter has produced. I am not a very pro photographer but like to add filters sometimes and this serves my purpose. I would recommend this if you dont want to spend a lot of money yet want a very good filter.
I totally agree with the positive reviews above. Until I found this face moisturizer, I had terrible problems with flaky dry patches combined with oily places. I tried lots of other moisturizers but nothing provided the kind of complete solution for my complexion. I LOVE THIS LOTION and can't believe it's been discontinued. It is not at all greasy - it feels light and soothing all day long. I also hope Eucerin reconsiders it's decision regarding this amazing product.
Except for What's Your Name, which is quite awful, this is a great record. It's simple, light, and rather comically gay-tinged, even though the lineup is all heterosexual. One can even see the leather bar look the band had on YouTube. I second the reviewer who said seek out the version that comes with the b-sides. This record shows bubble gum pop done right, unlike A Broken Frame. I'm not sure about the extended Just Can't Get Enough. Maybe that's something that was added later because I recall my tape had the regular version.
Pro - Product is of the highest quality. Con - I'm looking for rivets to fit this unit and can't find them!! Amazon do not carry them.
"When I heard ""Faith Children"" I nearly cried. It has such a haunting complexity to it. Like it's hinting at how simple things can be so frightening. I don't know, but it is lovely."
I got this book from the library yesterday and read it cover to cover in 24 hours. It is a wonderful coming-of-age book dealing with loss of innocence, and brings back all the physical and emotional feelings that come with puberty. Family dysfunction is dealt with in typical '60's style -- no over-analyzing or self-pity was allowed then!
I was looking for a good camcorder for beginers. This one is perfect. It is not the best camcorder, but a very good one. I gave it 5 stars because the price is cheaper than it should be.It is worth much more than it is.
To my unsophisticated ear the Recepter's sound is full and rich. I like the way they've implemented the station pre-sets. They're accessed via a rotary knob, not a lot of hard to find buttons, and you can mix AM and FM stations among then presets. The clock radio shuts itself off after 10 minutes and can be combined with an alarm. In general, I like the Recepter's controls and user interface. I also own a Kloss Model One, another outstanding piece of equipment, and the Recepter has comparable sound quality, which is saying a lot. The Recepter has the edge in ease of use and the Model One lacks a clock radio. One drawback, the Receptor lacks an audio-in jack, so you can't attach an IPod. The Kloss Model One permits attachment of the IPod. Overall, I highly recommend the Receptor.
I am writing this recommendation because I am on a high because I just got my acceptance letter in the mail. I had gotten deffered from NYU but I GOT INTO BC which is a better college. This is an incredible and undeniably the best guide in the world to writing an essay.
In this book there are three main characters,Ned Land, Professor Aronnax, and Captain Nemo. The book Twenty thousand Leagues Under the Sea was veryinteresting. It is very suspensful and you are always thinkingthat the characters are going to die. Their are mant differentsurvival scenes. For example one scene captain Nemo sees anindian gets attacked by a shark so he he jumps in the water and tackels the shark. He almost gets killed but Ned Land throws hisharpoon and kills the shark.This book reminds me of the ocean because they are always traveling through the ocean in their submarine. This book is very exciting because they are always going on different adventures. The book makes me think about when I first road on a sailboat. In the beginning of this book they are sailing on a boat.
Makes TiVo networking a snap! I tried several other adapters first, only to find that none were compatible. (That cost you a star, TiVo! Yes, I consulted the hardware list...) This item is well-made and attractive as gadgets go. For ease of setup, I highly recommend this adapter.
In all honesty I'm not a fan of the whole American Idol thing, but I did get sucked into AI2 just a bit. Yea for Clay! Moving on.This is strictly a pop album. No earth shattering lyrics, but plenty of catchy tunes and choruses. Clay does a wonderful job of singing this material. In a way Clay reminds me of Rick Ashley from the 80's because I didn't expect that voice/power to come from that person. Anyway, I have been enjoying this ablum. It's nice, mellow and light hearted. Good for those laid back moods or wanting to relax.Obviously this album is not for everyone, but give it a chance. It may grow on you.
Tess of the d'Urbervilles is possibly my favorite classic. Thomas Hardy is a brilliant writer as evidened by this novel. If you've never read it please do so. It's free on Amazon. You will fall in love with Tess and curse the life she is dealt.
Daughters of Darkness is the best yet!! I happened to pick it up by mistake in the Library and I Got hooked right away! I must have read it 50 times!! I loved the way Ash Tried to protect her from Jermey but she saved herself. I really hope there's another book on those two!
My nephew and I are going to South Africa for the World Cup. I took all the South Africa travel books out of the library and thought this one was the most clearly presented.
I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS STORY TO ANYONE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A GREAT UNDERSEA ADVENTURE BOOK. IT HAS AN EXCITING STORY LINE THAT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE REALLY THERE. I LIKE THE PART WHERE CAPTAIN NEMO SHOWS THE PROFESSOR THE UNDER HUGE WINDOW THAT LOOKS OUT TO THE SEA WHERE YOU CAN SEE COLORFUL SEA CREATURES. CAPTAIN NEMO TAKES THE PROFESSOR, CONSEIL AND NED ON SOME CRAZY ADVENTURES AND IT ALL ENDS TOO SOON. I WAS SAD TO GET TO THE END BUT I WON'T GIVE IT AWAY. YOU HAVE TO READ IT TO FIND OUT.FROM JARRETT WALKER #29 3RD GRADE, POET-CHRISTIAN SCHOOL, MS. WITZAK'S CLASS.
The best selling point is the ability to use normal PS2 controllers which are far superior to all RF controllers on the market. The unit is rechargeable, so you don't eat up batteries. Works great.
This headband is exactly what any Naruto fan needs. The metal on it is very durable and not that flexible plastic you find on other headbands. Only flaw is I wish the cloth was longer but other than that its perfect. This is THE headband to buy.
This book points out while at the absolute extreme mind you what the negative effects of censoring books can be. It is Ironic that this book is on the list of top 100 books challenged between 1990 and 2000. Besides being a great social commentary/civil liberties book, it is an exciting book. If you are in the mood just for a good page turner, read the book, if you are in the mood for a good social commentary, read the book.The story is basically about a man with an empty life who's job is to go around burning the homes of people who own books. A very good example of how empty a person's life can be without being able to exercise their mind. I think anyone who likes to read, will like this book.
I wish I Could give this book a 100! I read this book about 3 times a year, and never do get bored with it !!! ----WARNING----- This book is so absorbing,do not read it on a day where you have something planned.There is a 99.99999% chance you will!!!!
Life during the Great Depression was harsh. We see it through the eyes of a ten year old, boy, Jim. Yet the simplistic rigors or farm life lend strength, discipline, and tenacity to this little boy coming of age in Aliceville, North Carolina. His widowed mother and three endearing uncles help Jim face the turning points in his life with courage. The illness of a friend, the coming of electricity, and the marriage proposal his mother receives expands his world, and his adventures in a different local begin anew. Through his eyes, we remember ourselves as children, and easily identify with his perceptions. Touching and engaging.
Extreme Trains is a good show for people who want to know a little bit about railroading. Matt bown is a little hyper and awkward sometimes. There is lots of good information presented and interesting facts. If you have no intrest in trains this will put you to sleep. It would make a good Christmas present for younger kids and old people. Me personally I am a little bit of a train fan so I liked the show a good amount.
ELECTRIC SYKCHURCH IS A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF TODAYS RAVE SCENE. WANDERING THROUGH YOUR BODY LIKE A FLOW OF POSITIVE ENERGY. ITS A GREAT GROUP TO LISTEN TO, WHEN THE SUN IS COMING UP, AT A DESERT PARTY. A PERFECT END TO A NIGHT OF DANCING.
We were so excited to get this item. We have a missionary out right now and he requested it about 9 months ago but we had no success in finding it. UNTIL NOW! I haden't even thought of looking on Amazon. Great shipping and our missionary is finding this to be very handy. Thankyou!
This is a good movie. It had the misfortune of coming out around the same time as Julia Robert's feminist 'Mona Lisa Smile' and being sometimes confused with that film by critics. This is not a feminist, male-bashing movie. And it isn't entirely a 'chic flick' either. Diane Lane is apparently very picky about the roles she plays and the films she appears in. This is another good choice for her.There are plenty of reviews here telling what this film is about. I'll simply tell you that I bought the DVD for my wife, but I usually watch it with her. It is a good movie.
I heard Milk Rock and Spin Spider Spin on internet radio but I fell in love with Tiger. If she were to make a greatest hits CD I would vote for Tiger to be on it. It has a great flow to it like all of her music. On this CD I also liked Gently Waves and Soft Grafitti which are both quietly beautiful. I don't think the length of the song should dictate how much you like it, and that's certainly true of Gently Waves.
Well written - fast read - thoughtful - excellent footnotes.Clearly and forcefully refutes much of the fuzzy thinking of the last fifty years.
I didn't expect to be overwhelmed by this book, thinking it would be the typical albeit entertaining murder-mystery novel. Instead I encountered an exceedingly well written story with a warm, likeable protagonist and a plot that truly keeps you wondering until the last chapter. After reading this novel, I have since sought out and read all of Lindsey's novels. If you like a good, gory thriller, you have to read this book.
My knowledge of Richard III and the War of the Roses period of English history was limited but this book draws you in to the 15th century. Although the complexity of the royal lines at times seemed a bit confusing the goal is worth the work. This is the type of read that transcends the mystery genre. I would recommend this book unreservedly.
Excepts for shadows of Shame, i have loved every word he has written. he may exaggerate but he KNOWS Africa and how to tell a gripping yarn!
"The focus of the book is on the ""administrative"" end of the medical risk management spectrum. A book like this is a must for a physician facing a first time medical malpractice claim.My only desire is for a more substantial treatment of physician practices that mitigate risk prior to a claim being made."
Without any doubt,Cat among the pigeons is one of agatha christie's best.It is an awesome book.The story is set in an English bording school,Meadowbanks.I really love this book because the story is set in a school and agatha portrays the character of the teachers very well.I was happy POirot did not appear until the second murder had took place because i found him very annoying in the other books.However he really was a genius in solving the puzzle,which is fit for experts..Overall,Cat among the pigeons was immensely enjoyable and it is a must read!!!!!!!
This book was very helpful in letting us know about the ASVAB. It showed us how to get a better AFQT score as well as what areas we needed to score higher in to get the job we wanted. It was very easy to use and the practice tests were so helpful. My husband past the test and got the job area he wanted. It also prepared him for what the test day was like and gave him clues on how to stay at ease and help his knowledge be better used. We were in a hurry to study up and it was quick and to the point. I will probably look at other dummies books for other helps.
_The Descent_ is a movie featuring some very tough girls. Athletic, young, strong, mentally tough, and brave. When the going gets tough they meet the challenge and there is very little whining. Even when it comes time to die they face it bravely. In today's largely sedentary society where people are more concerned about political correctness than survival you aren't likely to meet many women (or men!) like this. But, one can always hope that there are still a few out there.
"This book is important reading for Catholics who take the practice of their Faith seriously. Time and again, during recent years, we have seen purportedly ""Catholic"" authorities, speaking through the media, contradicting beliefs universally taught pre-Vatican II.Has the Church changed so radically? Is what was once wrong, wrong no longer? Does it matter if the formal liturgy of the Mass is changed by the Celebrant? Why?Cecilia Martin documents many abuses, justified by their proponents as ""reform,"" currently assailing the Church. She shows how enemies hijacked the genuine reforms of Vatican II and selectively misinterpreted them to promote an agenda aimed at its destruction. Far fetched? Read the book! It is well written and referenced. Reach your own conclusions. If they are the same as Cecilia's, follow her advice on how to counteract this attack from within."
I feel that these are a necessity especially if you live in colder winter climates where you may have the windows closed for a few months.I prefer this model as it plugs in to an outlet rather than battery operated units.I found the models through Amazaon were several dollars cheaper than stores around my area.
The Witch of Blackbird Pond by Elizabeth George Speare is a pretty good book. It's very exciting and there is some romance, I don't see why it hasn't been a movie yet. I wouldn't give it the newberry award, it's good but not that phenomenal.
Tried many brands, Pampers is always the best. Soft and dry. Baby loves it! Especially in summer! From 8 month, my baby started to use size4. No leaking.
Fits as expected and is well made. It lacks a cord to tether it to your camera but you can easily purchase one that sticks on the front if you feel you need one. I however prefer to just keep the cap in my pocket when the camera is in use so its not flopping around and getting in the way.
I had seen the movie and wanted to read the book. Both were excellent in my opinion.I had never read any of the great classics and this book started me on that. I havesince read the War of the Worlds and Journey to the Center of the Earth
Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Keeps warm beverages warm. No, it will not heat a cold cup of coffee nor will it keep your beverage at scalding temperatures. But if you put your mug on it will your drink is still at least lukewarm, this doo-dad will keep it warm enough so that it's still pleasant to drink. To give you an idea of how hot this thing gets, the plate is warm enough that it *could* burn you if you left your hand on it, but will not burn with a quick touch.
but I had to make the time to finish the book to make sure that I wasn't missing anything. At times I felt there was something else that needed to be said to complete the story. Maybe for me, the author should have started with some background, instead of when the character cut off her hair, and then after she cut her hair she should have made her proud and not afraid of what others had to say about her, this should have been about her feelings and only about her feelings about her hair.

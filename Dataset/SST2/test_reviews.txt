an incredibly narrow in-joke targeted to the tiniest segment of an already obscure demographic .
-lrb- carvey 's -rrb- characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark .
right now , they 're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination .
another week , another gross-out college comedy -- ugh .
the laughs are as rare as snake foo yung .
coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock .
we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they 'll wind up together , and michele 's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest .
content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .
a pathetically inane and unimaginative cross between xxx and vertical limit .
it 's drab .
so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker 's characteristic style .
the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos had n't blown them all up .

the only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies .
shankman ... and screenwriter karen janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of bible parables and not an actual story .
donovan ... squanders his main asset , jackie chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences .
like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but did n't know how to handle it .
paul bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 .
... too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be .
the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries .
they cheapen the overall effect .
stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .
dogtown is hollow , self-indulgent , and - worst of all - boring .
this is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea -lrb- or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really -rrb- in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question ` why ? '
the premise itself is just sooooo tired .
the young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient .
... a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror .
it 's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie .

stealing harvard does n't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor .
witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic .

this is a movie you can trust .
clint eastwood 's blood work is a lot like a well-made pb & j sandwich : familiar , fairly uneventful and boasting no real surprises -- but still quite tasty and inviting all the same .
impossible as it may sound , this film 's heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition .
the film fearlessly gets under the skin of the people involved ... this makes it not only a detailed historical document , but an engaging and moving portrait of a subculture .

a thoughtful , reverent portrait of what is essentially a subculture , with its own rules regarding love and family , governance and hierarchy .
me no lika da accents so good , but i thoroughly enjoyed the love story .
this film is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success .
better still , he does all of this , and more , while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift .

i 've yet to find an actual vietnam war combat movie actually produced by either the north or south vietnamese , but at least now we 've got something pretty damn close .

though it runs 163 minutes , safe conduct is anything but languorous .
finally , the french-produced `` read my lips '' is a movie that understands characters must come first .
it 's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing ca n't possibly be enough .

when the movie mixes the cornpone and the cosa nostra , it finds a nice rhythm .
much smarter and more attentive than it first sets out to be .

a remarkably alluring film set in the constrictive eisenhower era about one suburban woman 's yearning in the face of a loss that shatters her cheery and tranquil suburban life .
